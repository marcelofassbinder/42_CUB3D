# About ‚úç
As part of the Milestone 04 of the 42 Common Core curriculum, Cub3D is a fun project, aiming to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you‚Äôll have to find your way. Inspired by Wolfenstein, the first "First Person Shooter" game ever, we utilize the raycasting algorithm to create the sense of tridimensional views through the game.
